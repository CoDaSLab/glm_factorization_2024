This repository requires the MEDA toolbox v1.4 at https://github.com/josecamachop/MEDA-Toolbox/releases/tag/v1.4


## missing_data

Code related to the simulations for missing data in Section 5 of the paper. As a function of an increasing percentage of missing data, a comparison between unconditional mean replacement (UMR), conditional mean replacement (CMR) and permutational conditional mean replacement (pCMR) are considered using different missingness patterns and mechanisms.

## power_curves_analysis

Code related to the power curve analysis for different types of randomized data in Section 5: normally distributed, uniformly distributed, exponentional cubed data, and uniformly distributed with one outlier. Visualization of the effects of different distributions on the semi-parametric estimation of apparent significance as a function of effect size.
