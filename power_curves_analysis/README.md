This repository requires the MEDA toolbox v1.4 at https://github.com/josecamachop/MEDA-Toolbox/releases/tag/v1.4

Power Curves of ASCA to identify the best permutation testing approach for different distributions and our specific design matrix. The folders contain the curves computed for the following distributions:

- Exp3: exponential distribution then cubed
- Uniform
- Normal
- Normal with an outlier

Figure 3 in Section 5.2 of the paper is reproduced with the script CreatePlot.
